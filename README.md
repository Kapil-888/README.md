###**Hello 👋**

I am Kapil Yadav. I am Masters candidate at King's College London. 

In parallel with my research, I work on intergrating statistical computation and machine learning models in biological research. 

When I find time, I code in R and share my codes here to help my juniors and colleagues with statistical analysis.
